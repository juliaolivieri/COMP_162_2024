# Classwork 7: Data Visualization with ggplot2

## Part 1: First plot
1. **(Classwork) Open a new R script file. This is what you will turn in for today's classwork.**
2. **(Classwork) Load the "tidyverse" library.**
3. View the dataset mpg with `View(mpg)` (this dataset is pre-loaded with the tidyverse package).
4. **(Classwork) Use the code above to create a plot of `displ` vs `hwy`.**
5. **(Classwork) Save this plot using `ggsave()` (example command above). You may want to set your working directory to a convenient place for the plot to be output.**
